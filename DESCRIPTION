Description: This workflow implements a low-level analysis pipeline for
        scRNA-seq data using scran, scater and other Bioconductor packages. It
        describes how to perform quality control on the libraries, normalization of
        cell-specific biases, basic data exploration, cell cycle phase identification,
        doublet detection and batch correction. Procedures to detect highly
        variable genes, significantly correlated genes and subpopulation-specific
        marker genes are also shown. These analyses are demonstrated on publicly
        available scRNA-seq data sets from a variety of protocols including 
        SMART-seq2 and 10X Genomics.
